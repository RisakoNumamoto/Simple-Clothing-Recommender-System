# Simple-Clothing-Recommender-System

This is CMPE188 Machine Learning course project.
We have used http://surpriselib.com/ to implement a recommender system for clothing.

Backend_draft.ipynb is an organized version of beckend only code.
Oraganized_GUI.ipynb is an organized version of front-end only code.
Our goal was integrating those both parts together for better usability.
However, integrating GUI classes to back-end caused some errors, which we needed more time to fix.
Project1.ipynb is our old file before the update, but its front-end and back-end were integrated better.
